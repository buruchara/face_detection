# face_detection
Face Detection program with OpenCV Library
# Webcam Face Detection

This is a Python script that uses OpenCV to perform real-time face detection using the webcam.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Haar cascade XML file for face detection

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages. Run the following command:

pip install opencv-python

3. Download the Haar cascade XML file for face detection (e.g., `haarcascade_frontalcatface.xml`) and place it in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

2. Run the script using the following command on cmd or powershell terminal:

python face_detection.py

3. The webcam will open, and the script will start detecting faces in real-time. Detected faces will be surrounded by green rectangles.

4. To exit the script, press the 'q' key or click the close window icon.


## Acknowledgments

- The face detection functionality is implemented using the OpenCV library.
- The Haar cascade XML file for face detection is based on the work of the OpenCV community.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code according to your needs!
